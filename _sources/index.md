Welcome to *introPy*
====================

This website contains information about the two-week Python & PsychoPy course taught at the Research Master Psychology (University of Amsterdam). 

## Prerequisites
As this two-week Python course is preceded by a two-week *R* course in the Research Master Psychology, we assume that students are familiar with basic programming concepts (such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions). Familiarity with Python is not necessary. Those that already have some experience with Python, however, may find the tutorials from this course (too) easy. To challenge those people, we included several more difficult (optional) sections and exercises in the tutorials!

## Teaching philosophy
We believe in *learning by doing*. Most of your time will be spent by working on exercises, which we call *ToDos*. Although these exercises are ungraded, we highly recommend that you try to do them. If you manage to work through all of them, getting a decent grade on this course is expected.

## Overview
In week 1, you will learn the basics of Python. We assume that you have some programming experience in other languages (e.g., Matlab or R). In week 2, you will learn about the Python package [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/), which you can use to program experiments. The preliminary program can be found below.

| Week | Day | Format           | Topic                                      |
|------|-----|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Mo. | Lecture          | Introduction to Python                     |
| 1    | Mo. | Tutorial         | Python essentials                          |
| 1    | We. | Lecture          | Working with data                          |
| 1    | We. | Tutorial         | Matplotlib + Pandas + Numpy                |
| 1    | Fr. | Assigment        | All of the above                           |
| 2    | Mo. | Lecture          | Introduction to stimulus presentation      |
| 2    | Mo. | Tutorial         | PsychoPy Builder                           |
| 2    | We. | -                | No lecture!                                |
| 2    | We. | Tutorial         | PsychoPy Coder                             |
| 2    | Fr. | Exam             | Create a PsychoPy experiment from scratch! |

Expect to spend about 20-40 hours per week on this course (as is expected for a four week, full-time 6 EC course), which includes watching the lecture, doing the tutorials (including exercises), and working on the assignments. The amount of time you need for this course depends, of course, on your previous experience with programming in general, and programming in Python specifically.

## Examination
For students from the Research Master taking this course, there will be two graded assignments: one on Friday in week 1 and one on Friday in week 2 (but the latter might be postponed). The assignment in week 1 will involve a task in which you need to use your Python and Pandas skills to preprocess some data, perform several simple analyses, and use Matplotlib to visualize the results. This will be done in a Jupyter notebook on our Jupyterhub server. For the assignment in week 2, you'll have to program an experiment from scratch using the PsychoPy Coder interface.   

For both assignments, you have 3 hours to complete it. It's an "open-book" assignment, but you have to do it on your (i.e., no collaboration with your fellow students), and you'll have to be present on Zoom during those three hours. The assignments are based only on the material discussed in the tutorials; the material that is indicated to be *optional* won't be part of either of the assignments. About 80% of the assignment will be similar in difficulty as most exercises ("ToDos") in the tutorials, but about 20% of the assignment will feature substantially more difficult exercises (similar in difficulty, but not in content, to the optional exercises from the tutorials). In other words, if you complete all tutorials, getting an 8 (out of 10) for the assignments is definitely doable. But getting a(n even) better grade will be more challenging!

## Learning goals
At the end of this course, you will ...

* know the major differences between Python and R;
* know the (dis)advantages of Python relative to other programming languages;
* understand the concept of "object-oriented programming";
* be able to create basic Python scripts;
* be able to implement basic data processing operations and visualization using [*pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/);
* know the basics of stimulus presentation;
* be able to implement simple experiments using the PsychoPy Builder and Coder interface.

Importantly, this course focuses on the *basics* of Python and PsychoPy, but we have highlighted several resources that you may use to continue your Python/PsychoPy journey [here](week_2/psychopy_how_to_continue.md).
