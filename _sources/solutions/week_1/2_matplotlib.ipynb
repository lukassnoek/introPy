Although many different plotting packages exist in the Python ecosystem (see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytuB8nFHPQ) for an overview), Matplotlib is arguably the most versatile and flexible. Here, we will give you a short tour of Matplotlib's most important features.\n",

As Matplotlib recommends using the object-oriented approach, we will spend most time on this approach. But you'll often see the state-based approach as well, so we'll start with quickly discussing this approach."

For example, instead of a line, we can plot the data as separate red points by specifying the format in the third argument (here, 'o' to indicate points) and the color (by setting the argument `c`, for **c**olor, to \"red\"):"
