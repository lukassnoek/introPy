    "Python is a multipurpose programming language, meaning it can be used for almost anything. While the \"standard library\" of Python (i.e., the functionality that is shipped with any Python installation) contains the bare minimum for any programming language, Python's versatility comes from a massive community of developers that created many different \"third-party\" packages for almost any purpose you can think of (e.g., visualization, machine learning, game programming, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) package provides functionality for scientific computing (e.g. statistics, signal processing);\n",
    "* the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) package provides data structures and functionality for (very fast) numeric computing (e.g. multidimensional numeric array computations, some linear algebra);\n",
    "* the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package provides functionality to work with \"tables\";\n",
    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",

Sure, there are things that we haven't discussed (e.g., [sets](https://realpython.com/python-sets/), [generators](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/), [inheritance](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/), [decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) and so on), but the material from this tutorial should be enough to get you started with Python (and the next tutorials)!\n",
